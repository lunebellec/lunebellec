I am an associate professor at the department of Psychology of University of Montreal and the principal investigator of the laboratory for brain simulation and exploration [SIMEXP](https://simexp-lab.org). The main line of researche at the SIMEXP lab is the Courtois project on neuronal modelling [CNeuroMod](https:cneuromod.ca). CNeuroMod aims at training artificial neural networks using extensive experimental data on individual human brain activity and behaviour. CNeuroMod replicates classic supervised learning tasks, such as image classification or video game play, as well as an extensive repertoire of videos. The SIMEXP lab also applies machine learning techniques to identify robust markers of brain disorders in multisite data. I am an FRQS chercheur boursier (Senior), as well as the scientific director of the Functional Neuroimaging Unit [UNF](https://unf-montreal.ca/) at the Montreal Geriatrics Institute [CRIUGM](criugm.qc.ca/). I am an open science enthusiast, and in particular I regularly contribute to [Brainhack](https://brainhack.org), the [Canadian Open Neuroscience Platform](https://conp.ca) and the [open science SIG](https://ossig.netlify.app/).
