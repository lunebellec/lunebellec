I am Lune (Pierre) Bellec, an associate professor at the [department of Psychology](https://psy.umontreal.ca/accueil/) of [University of Montreal](https://www.umontreal.ca/) and the principal investigator of the laboratory for brain simulation and exploration ([SIMEXP](https://simexp.github.io)) at the Montreal Geriatrics Institute ([CRIUGM](https://criugm.qc.ca/)). I recently joined [Mila](https://mila.quebec/en/) (Quebec AI research institute) as affiliated member, and I supervise students in computer science (cognitive computational neuroscience) at [DIRO](https://diro.umontreal.ca/accueil/), University of Montreal. 

My main research interest is to train artificial neural networks in order to jointly mimic individual human brain activity and behaviour. To achieve that goal, I lead an intensive effort of individual data collection in neuroimaging (fMRI, MEG), the Courtois project on neuronal modelling ([CNeuroMod](https://cneuromod.ca)). The SIMEXP lab also applies machine learning techniques to identify robust markers of brain disorders in multisite data, most notably as part of the Qu√©bec consortium on neurodegeneration in aging ([CIMA-Q](http://www.cima-q.ca/en/home/)). I am a Senior [FRQS](https://frq.gouv.qc.ca/en/) chercheur boursier, a member of the Quebec alliance for Unifying Neuroscience and AI ([UNIQUE](https://sites.google.com/view/unique-neuro-ai)), the [CerebrUM](https://www.lecerebrum.ca/en/home/) center. I lead several infrastructure projects and in particular the lead the "Digital Health" research theme at CRIUGM and the Neuroinformatics team of the [Canadian Pediatric Imaging platform](https://www.cpipstudy.org/).

Finally, I am an open science enthusiast: I co- founded and regularly contribute to [Brainhack](https://brainhack.org), [Brainhack school](https://school-brainhack.github.io/), the [Canadian Open Neuroscience Platform](https://conp.ca), the [open science SIG](https://ossig.netlify.app/), and a number of open source software librairies.
