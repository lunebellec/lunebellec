I am an associate professor at the department of Psychology of University of Montreal and the principal investigator of the laboratory for brain simulation and exploration [SIMEXP](https://simexp-lab.org). The main line of research at the SIMEXP lab is to train artificial neural networks in order to mimic individual human brain activity and behaviour using extensive experimental data, as part of the Courtois project on neuronal modelling [CNeuroMod](https:cneuromod.ca). The SIMEXP lab also applies machine learning techniques to identify robust markers of brain disorders in multisite data. I am an FRQS chercheur boursier (Senior), as well as the scientific director of the Functional Neuroimaging Unit [UNF](https://unf-montreal.ca/) at the Montreal Geriatrics Institute [CRIUGM](criugm.qc.ca/). I am an open science enthusiast, and in particular I regularly contribute to [Brainhack](https://brainhack.org), the [Canadian Open Neuroscience Platform](https://conp.ca) and the [open science SIG](https://ossig.netlify.app/), and a number of open source software librairies.

You can find a list of my publications on [google scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Yz8WY8YAAAAJ&hl=en) and contact me by [email](mailto:pierre.bellec@criugm.qc.ca), on [twitter](https://twitter.com/pierre_bellec) or on the [Brainhack mattermost](https://mattermost.brainhack.org).
