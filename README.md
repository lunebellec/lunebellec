I am an associate professor at the [department of Psychology](https://psy.umontreal.ca/accueil/) of [University of Montreal](https://www.umontreal.ca/) and the principal investigator of the laboratory for brain simulation and exploration ([SIMEXP](https://simexp-lab.org)) at the Montreal Geriatrics Institute ([CRIUGM](criugm.qc.ca/)). I also supervise students in computer science (neuroinformatics) at [DIRO](https://diro.umontreal.ca/accueil/), University of Montreal. 

My main research interest is to train artificial neural networks in order to jointly mimic individual human brain activity and behaviour. To achieve that goal, I lead an intensive effort of individual data collection in neuroimaging (fMRI, MEG), the Courtois project on neuronal modelling ([CNeuroMod](https:cneuromod.ca)). The SIMEXP lab also applies machine learning techniques to identify robust markers of brain disorders in multisite data, most notably as part of the Canadian Consortium on Neurodegeneration in Aging ([CCNA](https://ccna-ccnv.ca)). I am a Senior [FRQS](https://frq.gouv.qc.ca/en/) chercheur boursier, a member of the Quebec alliance for Unifying Neuroscience and AI ([UNIQUE](https://sites.google.com/view/unique-neuro-ai)), and the scientific director of the Functional Neuroimaging Unit ([UNF](https://unf-montreal.ca/)) at CRIUGM. 

Finally, I am an open science enthusiast, and I regularly contribute to [Brainhack](https://brainhack.org), the [Canadian Open Neuroscience Platform](https://conp.ca), the [open science SIG](https://ossig.netlify.app/), and a number of open source software librairies.

You can find a list of my publications on [google scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Yz8WY8YAAAAJ&hl=en) and contact me by [email](mailto:pierre.bellec@criugm.qc.ca), on [twitter](https://twitter.com/pierre_bellec) or on the [Brainhack mattermost](https://mattermost.brainhack.org).
